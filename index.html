      <h3></h3>
      <p>The two are devoted Christians. Stefan, like Paul is a lawyer who was arrested by God to be a shepherd.
      I know Paul was going to Damascus when God caught him. But where was Stefan Going when he was arrested? Well, God didnt come down to blind him,
    but He used His servant, Deborah. After, God said, "Well done my daughter for bringing him to me. For your reward....."</p>

      <h2>Joshua</h2>
      <img class="" src="images/jjoshua.jpg" alt="computer-img">

      <p>He is a young man full of energy for God. As you can see, he is playing his instrument to produce the sound effect
      that brought the wall of Jericho down. He believes in miracles because of what God has done for him. </p>

      <h2>Daniel</h2>
      <img class="" src="images/daniel.jpg" alt="computer-img">

      <p>The last is prophet Daniel. He does not fear anything, including lions. Sometimes, people do not understand him, but
      God does. He will one day be a great shepherd for the Kingdom of God. </p>
